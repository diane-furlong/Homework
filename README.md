# RefactorHoriseon

## Description 

This project was a CWRU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment. The user story given was that a marketing agency wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.

This introductory homework assignment allowed for practice in taking existing code and refactoring it to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. This assignment also was an introduction to the concept of web accessibility. 

To make this site accessible, the acceptance criteria needed to be met were the following.

  GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:

  WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements

  WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

  WHEN I view the image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes

  WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order

  WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
